	SOLVERS

	Our Cube has its own animation loop conveniently called Cube.loop().
	If Cube.isSolving === true then within that loop Cube will call
	window.solver.consider( cube ). This means when you create your own
	Solver instance you have to set window.solver equal to your instance.

	Solver.consider() will do some very basic checking and if all's well
	will pass the Cube instance to Solver.logic() which is the function that
	you need to write yourself. 

	Your logic() should return false is the cube is solved or if something's
	gone horribly wrong. This will set Cube.isSolving = false and stop the
	solver from being called within the Cube's animation loop. 

	Your logic() should return true if an incremental improvement has been 
	made and the logic() should be run again in the next loop; For example,
	run again after a twist queue completes.
